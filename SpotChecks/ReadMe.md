What is a “Spot Check” 
--------------
   A "Spot Check" is basically a point in time health check that focuses on key user experience metrics with known levels of acceptable performance. Review of data from multiple dates and times is critical before making recommendations or changes in the environment. The thresholds represented in these documents are validated by many vendors and experts in the industry.

   Different solutions on the market collect data in many ways, with different levels of accuracy and granularity. The values in these documents should not be applied to other monitoring or diagnostic solutions as they may not apply or be valid. These documents are designed for evaluation using Stratusphere UX.
