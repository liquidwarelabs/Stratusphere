<br>What is a “Spot Check”<br>
   The thresholds represented in these documents are at a 1 hour level of granularity unless otherwise specified in the description. Spot Checks are basically point in time health checks. Review of data from multiple dates and times is critical before making changes or recommendations. Normal and High Usage dates and times should be examined based on the industry and user requirements.

  Many years of monitoring and diagnosing systems have allowed our SEs to put this document together. Many of the thresholds are best practices for the hypervisor or the MS Windows OS and some are just industry standards.
