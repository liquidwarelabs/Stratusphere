Stratusphere API Automation<br>
--------------
   The JSON REST API provided in Stratusphere allows access to all the data in the Stratusphere database with extensive filters and query capabilities. Clients have asked if Stratusphere could automate the API but the definition of "REST API" is a "PULL" technology. It is up to external systems to activate the API and pull the data required.<br>

   The attached ZIP file has examples of API Pulls and Automation that can be done with Windows.<br>


Note: The Stratusphere API MUST be enabled with IP and/or User Based Security to access the information. It is not turned on by default.<br>
